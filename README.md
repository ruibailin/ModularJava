# ModularJava
An example for more modularized SWT Java program

Java is a very modularized coding language, 
unfortunately most Java programmers fail to use Java's modularized feature such as inheritage and interface to make the programe modularized.
they simply put all data and variables into one big class which makes the class very complicated.

In this project, I give some examples to use inheritage feature to make SWT programe more easy to understand.
